Why to use custom header file ?

1.Code reusablity 
one code can be used as many time as we need (Function _declaration,macros,and constant)

2.Modularity
Code can be divided into multiple files.(code ko logical part me tor sakte hai )


3.Readability
Code is more organized and easy to understand.(jab code alag alag file me organize hota hai to padhna aur samjna easy rehta hai )


4.Maintainabilty
Easy to update and debug.(agar code alag alag file me hai to update karna aur debug karna easy rehta hai )


5.Efficiency
Compilation time is reduced.(jab code alag alag file me hota hai to compilation time kam lagta hai )
