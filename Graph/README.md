## Introduction

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of:
- **Vertices (Nodes):** Represent entities or objects.
- **Edges:** Represent connections or relationships between vertices.

Graphs can be:
- **Directed:** Edges have a direction (A -> B is different from B -> A).
- **Undirected:** Edges have no direction (A - B is the same as B - A).
- **Weighted:** Edges have an associated cost or weight.
- **Unweighted:** Edges have no weight (or are considered to have a weight of 1).

This repository provides implementations for various graph types and common algorithms operating on them.

## Representations

How a graph is stored significantly impacts algorithm performance. Two common methods are:

### Adjacency List
- An array (or map) where each index (or key) corresponds to a vertex.
- The value at each index (or key) is a list (or set) of its adjacent vertices (and optionally edge weights).
- **Pros:** Space-efficient for sparse graphs (few edges). Efficient to iterate over neighbors.
- **Cons:** Checking for a specific edge (u, v) can take O(degree(u)) time.
- **Implementation:** `[Link to your Adjacency List implementation file]`

### Adjacency Matrix
- A 2D array `adj[V][V]` where `V` is the number of vertices.
- `adj[i][j] = 1` (or weight) if there's an edge from vertex `i` to `j`, otherwise `0` (or infinity).
- **Pros:** Checking for a specific edge (u, v) takes O(1) time. Simple for dense graphs.
- **Cons:** Requires O(V^2) space, which is inefficient for sparse graphs. Adding/removing vertices is costly.
- **Implementation:** `[Link to your Adjacency Matrix implementation file]`

## Algorithms Implemented

This repository includes the following graph algorithms:

### Traversal
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores neighbor nodes level by level. Used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
  - `[Link to BFS implementation]`
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Used for cycle detection, topological sorting, and finding connected components.
  - `[Link to DFS implementation]`

### Shortest Path
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
  - `[Link to Dijkstra implementation]`
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex, even with negative edge weights. Can detect negative cycles.
  - `[Link to Bellman-Ford implementation]`
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Handles negative edge weights (but not negative cycles).
  - `[Link to Floyd-Warshall implementation]`

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
*(For undirected, weighted graphs)*
- **Prim's Algorithm:** Builds the MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
  - `[Link to Prim's implementation]`
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Builds the MST by iteratively adding the lowest-weight edge that doesn't form a cycle.
  - `[Link to Kruskal's implementation]`

### Topological Sort
*(For Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAGs)*
- Linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. Often implemented using DFS or Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based).
  - `[Link to Topological Sort implementation]`

### Cycle Detection
- Algorithms to detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs, often using DFS.
  - `[Link to Cycle Detection implementation]`
