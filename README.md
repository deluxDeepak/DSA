# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms! This space contains my implementations of various DSA concepts, primarily focused on **C++ ***.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

*   Solidify my understanding of fundamental and advanced data structures.
*   Practice implementing common algorithms efficiently.
*   Solve problems from various platforms (like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeekForGeeks,etc.).


## Contents

This repository is organized into folders, typically categorized by:

*   **Data Structures:** Implementations of structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.
*   **Algorithms:** Implementations of algorithms related to Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversal, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.


## Technologies Used

*   **Primary Language:** [ C++]
*   **Compiler/Environment:** [e.g., g++, Visual Studio Code] 

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```In Your Terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/deluxDeepak/DSA.git # To clone the repository and file( Complete ) 
    ```
2.  **Navigate** to the specific data structure or algorithm folder.
3.  **Compile and Run:** (Instructions for compilation and setup)
    *   **For C++ (using g++):**
        ```In Your Terminal:
        g++ filename.cpp -o output_executable  # Adjust flags as needed
        ./output_executable
        ```
